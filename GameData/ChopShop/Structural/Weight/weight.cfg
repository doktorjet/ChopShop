// According to https://github.com/BobPalmer/MKS/issues/699 no more NICE solution is left to avoid conflicts with CRP. 
// Clutering is still better then bundling heresy and CRP is a heresy, since it contains Kethane. Arrrgh!!! 
// Foregoing RESOURCE_DEFINITION config WILL overwrite CRP values, since my mod is loaded first alphabetically. 
// On the other hand it shouldn't break anything as values are the same... and real physic parameters of lead are pretty constant.
